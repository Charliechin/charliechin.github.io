    <p>The Build Engine was one of the most influential of the mid-to-late 90s. Games like Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow
      Warrior, and Blood were built on its foundations, but as quickly as it rode to prominence, it fell into disuse as
      more advanced engines emerged.</p>

    <p> Gone, but clearly not forgotten, as developer Voidpoint has dusted off this legacy engine and created a new
      first
      person shooter that calls back to those halycon days.That game is Ion Fury.</p>
    <p>The action kicks off as Neo DC is invaded by Dr Heskel and his army of cybernetics, rudely interrupting the
      evening plans of our heroine, Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison. Naturally, she just grabs her gun and starts blasting.

      The first enemy type you encounter is a brown robed robot that wields a machine gun, the grunts of Heskel’s
      forces. They’re soon joined by the red robed robot and its ion bow, a shotgun wielding robot, and and spider-like
      bots that can quickly get in close and prove a nuisance to kill due to their small size. The first act keeps
      things fairly simple, but more varied and tougher enemies emerge the further you get into Ion Fury.</p>
